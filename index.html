                <p>
                    I'm Matt Galan, a third year software engineering major at the
                    Rochester Institute of Technology, born and raised in Fairport, NY.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although I'm interested in exploring the wider field of software engineering,
                    I'm currently loving the user-focused front-end work I'm doing at Intuit. I love
                    a good opportunity to combine my technical and creative skills, and front-end development
                    allows me to do just that.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My non-technical interests include hosting board game nights with friends, disc golfing,
                    and destroying family friends in pickleball. I can ski just well enough to get myself into
                    trouble, and even had a short-lived skateboarding phase.
                </p>
